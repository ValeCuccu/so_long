# 🎮 so_long — 2D Game Using MiniLibX

## 🧭 Project Description

**so_long** is a graphical project at 42 School where you build a small 2D game using the **MiniLibX** graphics library.

The goal is to create a playable game where the player moves inside a map, collects items, and reaches an exit, while learning:

- Event handling
- Window management
- Texture rendering
- Map parsing and validation
- Basic game loop logic

This project introduces you to **graphics programming**, **user input handling**, and **game state management** in C.
